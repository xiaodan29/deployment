# Mini-project IV

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
- To build a supervised learning model that will predict whether or not a loan would be approved.
- Deploy the model to cloud and test it by using different tools

## Hypothesis
-Applicants that have a good credit history are likely to get approved 
-Applicants with higher applicant and coapplicant income 
-Applicants with a higher level of education may earn more, and therefore more likely to be approved 
-Number of dependents may affect eligibility due to less disposable income with more dependents 

## Process
#### Step 1
Hypothesis generation

#### Step 2
Data exploration -EDA

#### Step 3
Data cleaning

#### Step 4
Building a predictive model using pipeline

### Step 5
Model deployment

## Results/Demo
- Tried different models, the best one is the logistic regression model 

## Challanges 
- I got some difficulty about how to correctly using pipeline with multiple different classifiers 
- Second, I got some difficulty with deploying to AWS.
But finaly, i made it for the whole part.
